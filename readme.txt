The purpose of this Matlab code is to optimize the dynamics of giving system. In the present version, this focus on the bilinear dynamics in quantum mechanics (assuming that a projection on an operator basis as been done such that all equation are real) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
In the current version the different options available to compute dynamics are not fully unified in a single, simple framework, this work will be done as soon as possible.
In a future release, a tutorial giving explanation about the code and how to use it will be available.
